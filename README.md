# TCGA-GDC-API_wrapper
Wrapper developed with the idea to explore which is all the data aviable in GDC database and download if so.

The download can be done providing filters easily, with a normal language query, that follows the structure: 
"*1value,2value;in;1field;and;3value,4value;in;anotherfield*"
